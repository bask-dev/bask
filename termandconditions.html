        national or resident of any such country or on any such list, and that you acknowledge you are responsible to obtain
        any necessary U.S. government authorization to ensure compliance with U.S. law. 4. AVAILABILITY OF SERVICES 4.1 General
        Availability. You acknowledge that the Services may not be available at all times, and may not be available in the
        format generally marketed, and some Computer Systems and Devices may not be able to receive the Services even if

        you to receive the Services, which will be provided remotely, the Company will qualify your Internet connection for
        the minimum line rate (speed) available for support based on the Company’s standard line qualification procedures.

        the Company, the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to schedule a mutually convenient Service session
        within a reasonable period of time. However, you acknowledge that circumstances outside of the Company’s control
        (for example, a large scale outbreak of a new computer virus), scheduling conflicts and/or other unforeseen circumstances
        may cause significant delays in the Company’s ability to schedule a Service session and/or to otherwise attend a
        scheduled Service session. In the event that such circumstances cause the Company to miss a scheduled Service Session,
        the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to re-schedule a mutually convenient Service session within
        a reasonable period of time. 5. FEES FOR SERVICES 5.1 Plans and Fees. You agree to pay the fees for the Services

        early termination fee. Without in any way limiting the foregoing, you also agree to pay the following fees for on-site
        support Services (if applicable): • On-Site Support. The Company offers on-site support Services for Company member
        plans through a third party service provider. Pricing for on-site support Services covers only the on-site Services

        guarantee that the Services will meet your business needs. You acknowledge and agree that you are authorizing the

        the Company may suspend your account until the applicable account activity has been verified. 7. PAYMENTS 7.1 Payment
        Method. You authorize the Company to permit its third party credit payment processing vendor to process all amounts
        owed to the Company under this Agreement. You will at all times maintain valid and current credit card information.
        If you terminate your credit card or elect to pay for the Services with a different credit card, or if you receive
        a new account number for your credit card, you shall immediately notify Company’s third party credit payment processing
        vendor of such termination or change. If for any reason fees owed cannot be billed to your credit card for any amount
        owed under this Agreement, you authorize the Company to bill you directly for such amount, which amount, together
        with any late fees, chargeback (defined below) or other fees set forth in this Agreement, shall be immediately due
        and payable. 7.2 Payment Obligations. You agree to pay all amounts owed to the Company under this Agreement, as well
        as any applicable taxes and other charges, when due. 7.3 Charges. The Company reserves the right to charge any amounts

        conclusion of the Services. 7.4 Late/Chargeback Fees; Attorneys’ Fees. For any amount (a) not paid to the Company
        when due; or (b) paid by you via credit card which (i) the credit card issuer (the ‘issuer’) later rejects or refuses
        to pay, or (ii) the Company is later required to reimburse the issuer (each, a ‘chargeback’), then in each case,
        the Company reserves the right to charge and you agree to pay, in addition to the amount not paid, rejected or refused,
        a fee of 10% of such amount, or the highest rate allowed under applicable law, whichever is lower, and to pay interest
        on the overdue amount at the rate of 1.5% per month, or the highest rate allowed by applicable law, whichever is
        lower, until paid in full. In addition, you agree to pay all collection costs, including reasonable attorney’s fees,
        incurred by the Company in collecting any amounts that you owe to the Company, whether incurred before or after civil
        litigation is commenced. 8. PERFORMANCE OF THE SERVICES With respect to any claim that any of the Services were deficient,
        you must notify the Company within five (5) calendar days following the Company’s performance of such Services. If
        you fail to give the Company written notice of such deficiency within such 5-day period, the Company will not be
        required to remedy such deficiency. Provided that you give Company notice in accordance with this paragraph, the
        Company agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to remedy such deficiency and, in connection therewith, you
        agree to give the Company reasonable access to your Computer Systems and Devices covered by the Services, as well
        as access to your home or office premises if necessary to enable such efforts. If the Company, using commercially
        reasonable efforts, is unable to remedy any deficiency in Services provided, then the Company, in its sole discretion,
        may elect to issue you a refund for the deficiencies on Services provided, as specified in Section 9 below. Notwithstanding
        the foregoing, the Company’s liability to you shall be limited as specified in this Agreement. 9. REFUND POLICY Fees
        for prior months of Services are nonrefundable. If the Company is unable to remedy a deficiency in the Services pursuant
        to Section 8 above or Section 17.2 below, the Company may elect to issue you a refund for the applicable deficiency
        based on the Services provided, in the Company’s sole discretion. If it is deemed that a refund is due, a credit
        will be issued to the credit card that was used to purchase Company’s Services. 10. TERM AND TERMINATION 10.1 Effective
        Date and Term. The initial term for all annual subscription Services continues for one (1) year from the date that
        you first register for such Services (the ‘Initial Term’). Thereafter, this Agreement shall automatically renew for
        additional one (1) year terms (each a ‘Renewal Term’ and together with the Initial Term, the ‘Term’), subject to
        earlier termination pursuant to Section 10.2 or Section 10.3 below, until such time as the Company or you provide

        have the right to cure any breach within thirty (30) days following its receipt of written notice from you of such
        breach. If the Company is unable to reasonably remedy any breach of this Agreement and such breach substantially
        impairs your use of the Computer Systems and Devices specifically registered with or otherwise authorized by the
        Company for use in connection with the Services covered under this Agreement, you may terminate this Agreement upon
        written notice to the Company. In any such case, the Company’s liability to you shall be limited as specified in
        this Agreement. 10.3 Termination and/or Suspension by the Company. If, as determined by the Company in its sole discretion:

        any of the Services, the Company’s network, or the use and enjoyment of the Services by third parties; (c) the Company
        receives an order from a court to terminate the Services provided to you; (d) the Company for any reason ceases to
        offer any of the Services previously made available to you under this Agreement; or (e) you are abusing or otherwise
        misusing any of the Services, then, in any such case, the Company at its sole election may terminate this Agreement
        or suspend one or more of the Services immediately without notice. 10.4 Terminated Account. The Company, in its sole
        discretion, may refuse to accept your request for Service, renewal or re-subscription following a termination or
        suspension of your use of any of the Services. In the event you terminate your subscription, you agree to pay to
        the Company the fees set forth in Section 5.1 above. 10.5 Effect of Termination. Upon the termination or expiration
        of your account or this Agreement for any reason, your right to use the Services and the Licensed IP (defined below)
        and your access to the Services (including any content you submit) shall immediately terminate, and you must immediately
        return all Licensed IP to the Company. You acknowledge that the Company is not obligated to provide a copy of your
        Content or data to you or to any third party, and that upon termination or expiration of this Agreement for any reason,
        the Company may purge your content and data from its systems without notice to you. 10.6 Survival. The rights and
        obligations of the parties set forth in this Section 10.6 and Sections 3, 5.1, 7, 10.4, 10.5, 10.6, 11, 12, and 14
        — 23 of this Agreement, and any right or obligation of the parties in this Agreement which, by its express terms
        or nature and context is intended to survive termination or expiration of this Agreement, will survive any such termination
        or expiration. 11. GOVERNING LAW, JURISDICTION AND VENUE; JURY WAIVER; CLAIM LIMITATIONS 11.1 Governing Law, Jurisdiction

        TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS
        MEMBER ON ANY CLASS CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST COMPANY INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY RIGHT TO CLASS ARBITRATION
        OR ANY CONSOLIDATION OF INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS. WITHOUT LIMITATION, THIS INCLUDES GIVING UP YOUR RIGHTS TO BRING
        OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AS SET FORTH IN ANY STATE STATUTE. If you are a California resident, to the extent

        not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the
        release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor’ as well as any other
        unknown claims under California Civil Code Section 1542 or any statute or common law principle of similar effect.

        PARTY SERVICES 12.1 Licensed IP. The Services (and all copyright and other proprietary or intellectual property rights),
        all software, CDs, programs, documentation and other intellectual property which is owned by the Company and/or which
        the Company makes available or furnishes to you pursuant to this Agreement, via download, other media, or other delivery
        method, and/or in connection with the provision of the Services, and all other rights and derivative works related
        thereto are referred to as the ‘Licensed IP.’ The Licensed IP is accompanied by the following end-user access license
        agreement and similar agreements: • HFN End User License Agreement Your use of the Licensed IP is governed by the
        terms of such agreement and by this Agreement, where applicable. You may not install or use any Licensed IP that
        is accompanied by or includes an end-user access license agreement unless you first agree to the terms and conditions
        of the end-user access license agreement. With regard to any Licensed IP for which your acceptance of a separate
        license agreement is not required, the Company hereby grants to you one limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable,
        non-sub-licensable license to access and use the same, only during the term of this Agreement, solely for your own
        personal or internal business purposes with respect to the Computer Systems and Devices specifically registered with
        or otherwise authorized by the Company for use in connection with the Services subject to this Agreement, and only
        as part of or for use with the Services and for no other purpose. You agree not to copy, modify, publish, transmit,
        rent, license, re-sell, sublicense, transfer, trade, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or attempt to derive
        source code or other intellectual property from the Company or allow others to use or benefit from any of the Licensed
        IP. You acknowledge and agree that you are not granted any title or rights of ownership in any of the Licensed IP.
        The Company reserves the right to update or change the Licensed IP from time to time and you agree to cooperate in
        performing such steps as may be necessary to install any updates or upgrades to the Licensed IP. All rights not expressly
        granted to you pursuant to this Section 12.1 are expressly reserved by the Company and any Third Party Providers,
        licensors, and suppliers, as applicable. If any software included within the Licensed IP is being acquired by or
        on behalf of the U.S. Government or by a U.S. Government prime contractor or subcontractor (at any tier), then the
        U.S. Government’s rights in the software and accompanying documentation will be only as set forth in this Agreement;
        this is in accordance with 48 C.F.R. 227.7201 through 227.7202–4 (for Department of Defense (DOD) acquisitions) and
        with 48 C.F.R. 2.101 and 12.212 (for non-DOD acquisitions). All software included within the Licensed IP is either
        a commercial product, produced entirely at private expense, copyrighted and owned by the Company or a third party
        provider or supplier, licensed to the Company or is otherwise proprietary to the Company. 12.2 Licensed IP Confidentiality
        and Ownership. You agree that the Licensed IP is confidential information of the Company or its Third Party Providers,
        licensors, or suppliers, and that you will not disclose the Licensed IP or any other confidential information of
        the Company to others or use the Licensed IP or any other confidential information except as expressly permitted
        herein. The Licensed IP contains copyrighted material, trade secrets, patents, and proprietary information owned
        by the Company or its Third Party Providers, licensors, or suppliers. You agree not to remove or alter any trademark,
        trade name, copyright or other proprietary notices, legends, symbols, or labels appearing on or in copies of any
        of the Licensed IP. You acknowledge that the license in Section 12.1 above, is not a sale of intellectual property
        and that the Company or its Third Party Providers, licensors, or suppliers will continue to own all right, title
        and interest, including but not limited to all copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret, and moral rights, to the
        Licensed IP and related documentation, as well as any corrections, updates and upgrades. 12.3 Third Party Software.
        As part of the Services, the Company may sublicense to you or suggest the acquisition, installation and use of certain
        Licensed IP that is third party software (the ‘Third Party Software’). You acknowledge that any Third Party Software
        will be sublicensed to you by the Company or licensed to you by the Third Party Provider that is the owner or licensee
        of the Third Party Software. You agree to be bound by and subject to the terms and conditions set forth by such Third
        Party Providers before installing Third Party Software, regardless of whether the Company sublicenses to you or assists
        you in the acquisition, installation, and/or use of Third Party Software. The Company has no rights to the Third
        Party Software and does not license Third Party Software to you except to the extent that the Company is a reseller
        or licensee of the Third Party Software. The Company does not make any representation or warranty regarding the Third
        Party Software. 12.4 Assistance and Support. The Company will provide technical assistance and support for the Licensed
        IP in accordance with its then current policies, which the Company may change from time to time in its sole discretion.
        To the extent that the Company provides technical assistance and support for any Third Party Software or equipment,
        you agree to comply with the terms and conditions under which you licensed such Third Party Software or purchased
        such equipment. The Company makes no representation or warranty that it is an authorized service provider for any
        Third Party Software or for any equipment, and you acknowledge and agree that it is your sole responsibility to determine
        if you require additional rights for the Company to provide such support and, if so, to acquire such rights. You
        acknowledge that support of Third Party Software or equipment by an unauthorized service provider may void any warranty
        made by the supplier of such Third Party Software or equipment. 13. INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR You acknowledge that the
        Company is an independent contractor and neither the Company nor any of its directors, officers, agents, employees,
        or affiliates is or shall be deemed employed by you. The Company reserves the right to determine the method, manner
        and means by which the Services will be performed. The Company and its directors, officers, agents, employees, and
        affiliates are not required to perform the Services for you during any particular hour of the day or night, and the
        time spent accessing your Computer Systems and Devices covered by the Services is at the Company’s discretion, subject
        to your access times and security requirements. You further acknowledge that the Company is not required to devote
        its full time or the full time of any of its directors, officers, agents, employees, or affiliates to the performance
        of the Services, and you acknowledge that the Company has other clients and that it offers Services to the general
        public. The order and sequence in which the Services are to be performed shall be under the control of the Company
        and its agents, employees and affiliates, and not under your control. 14. LIMITATIONS AND RISKS 14.1 Limitations
        of Liability. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COMPANY OR ITS AGENTS, EMPLOYEES, AFFILIATES, DIRECTORS OR OFFICERS OR ANY THIRD
        PARTY PROVIDERS, LICENSORS OR SUPPLIERS HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO YOU OR ANY OTHER THIRD PARTY, AND YOU AGREE TO RELEASE
        AND HOLD THE COMPANY AND ITS AGENTS, EMPLOYEES, AFFILIATES, DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS AND ANY THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS,

        IS GROSSLY NEGLIGENT IN PERFORMING THE SERVICES; OR (D) CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE
        DAMAGES EVEN IF ADVISED IN ADVANCE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SOME STATE STATUTES MAY APPLY RESTRICTIONS
        REGARDING LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY. THE SOLE AND MAXIMUM LIABILITY OF THE COMPANY AND ITS AGENTS, EMPLOYEES, AFFILIATES,
        DIRECTORS, OFFICERS AND THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS, LICENSORS AND SUPPLIERS, AND YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY
        AND ALL CLAIMS WHATSOEVER, WHETHER BASED ON BREACH OF CONTRACT, BREACH OF WARRANTY, TORT, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, PRODUCT
        LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT THAT YOU PAID FOR THE SERVICES WITHIN THE THREE MONTHS IMMEDIATELY
        PRECEDING THE INITIAL CLAIM MADE BY YOU IN WHICH THE COMPANY IS LIABLE TO YOU FOR SUCH CLAIM. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT
        THE COMPANY HAS SET ITS FEES AND ENTERED INTO THIS AGREEMENT IN RELIANCE UPON LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY AND THE DISCLAIMERS
        OF WARRANTIES AND DAMAGES SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT THESE PROVISIONS FORM AN ESSENTIAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN
        BETWEEN THE PARTIES. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY AND DISCLAIMERS SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT
        WILL SURVIVE AND APPLY EVEN IF PORTIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT ARE FOUND TO HAVE FAILED IN THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. 14.2
        Risk of Loss. You agree that your use of the Services is your sole responsibility and is solely at your own risk.
        You acknowledge and agree that the Internet, over which many of the Services are delivered, is not owned, operated
        or managed by, or in any way affiliated with the Company, and you agree that the Company is not responsible for and
        has no control over the information, content or other materials, some of which may be offensive, malicious or destructive
        in nature, which may be accessed on the Internet through use of the Services. You acknowledge and agree that the
        Internet is not a secure network and that third parties may be able to intercept, access, use, or corrupt the information
        that you transmit or receive over the Internet, whether in connection with the Company’s provision of the Services
        or otherwise. The Company is not responsible for invalid destinations, transmission errors, or corruption or security
        of your data. You further acknowledge and agree that the Company does not own or control all of the various facilities
        and communications lines through which Services may be provided and that the Company does not guarantee access to

        or facilities are owned or controlled by the Company. You acknowledge and agree that remotely accessing your Computer
        Systems and Devices covered by the Services may expose the same and the data contained therein to certain security
        risks and that you, and not the Company, shall be responsible for such security risks. You acknowledge that due to
        the nature of the Services being performed, you are exposed to some potential risk of damage or loss including, without
        limitation, damage to your computer hardware, cabling, hubs, routers, switches, peripherals, accessories, furniture,
        home, and office, as well as potential risk of damage, corruption, loss of business or time, loss of computer software,
        applications, data, and data storage media. You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to take proper and adequate
        measures to preserve, protect and safeguard critical data by backing up such data in appropriate ways prior to any
        Services being performed by the Company. Unless specifically requested and provided to you as a paid Service by the
        Company, you acknowledge and agree that you are exclusively responsible for providing all backup, archiving, and
        protective storage as well as restoration, if required, of your data. 15. WARRANTY LIMITATIONS THE SERVICES (INCLUDING,
        WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE) ARE PROVIDED ON AN ‘AS IS’ BASIS, AND YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES (INCLUDING,
        WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE) IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. THE COMPANY WILL USE COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE EFFORTS

        AND THE COMPANY DOES NOT MAKE, AND HEREBY DISCLAIMS, ANY AND ALL EXPRESS AND IMPLIED WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE
        SERVICES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE), INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF

        conditions set forth in this Agreement to the exclusion of any standard terms you may customarily have for the purchase
        of services. No other agreement, representations, warranties or other matters, oral or written, purportedly agreed
        to or represented by or on behalf of the Company or any of its agents, employees and affiliates, or contained in
        any sales materials or brochures, shall be deemed to bind the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter of
        this Agreement. You acknowledge that you are entering into this Agreement based solely on the basis of the terms
        contained herein. 17. INDEMNIFICATION; INFRINGEMENT REMEDY 17.1 Indemnification Obligations. You agree to defend,
        indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its directors, stockholders, officers, agents and employees from and
        against all liabilities, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorney’s fees, related to or arising from: (a)
        your violation of any applicable laws or regulations, this Agreement, the Privacy Policy or the terms of any agreement
        governing your use of Third Party Software (or any of the foregoing by parties who use your account, with or without
        your permission, to access the Service); (b) the use of the Services or the Internet or the placement or transmission
        of any message, information, software or other materials on the Internet by you (or any parties who use your account,
        with or without your permission, to access the Services); (c) acts, errors, or omissions by you (or any parties who
        use your account, with or without your permission, to access the Services); (d) any and all claims for damage or
        injury to persons or property or for loss of life or limb whereby you have been found liable to any third party under
        any product liability, tort liability or similar action that may in any way arise out of or result from or in connection
        with this Agreement, except to the extent that such liabilities arise from the gross negligence or willful misconduct
        of the Company; or (e) claims for infringement of any intellectual property rights arising from the use of the Services,
        Third Party Software, the Content, or the Internet, except with respect to the Licensed IP, subject to Section 17.2
        below. 17.2 Infringement Remedy. In the event that any portion of the Licensed IP is, in the Company’s sole opinion,
        likely to or does become the subject of a claim of infringement of any intellectual property rights arising from
        the use of the Services, the Company may, at its option and expense, procure for you the right to continue using
        the Services or modify the Services to make them non-infringing. If, in the Company’s sole opinion, neither of the
        foregoing options is reasonably available to the Company, then the Company may (a) terminate this Agreement immediately
        upon written notice to you, and in no event shall such termination be considered a breach of this Agreement; and
        (b) in its sole discretion, elect to issue you a refund for all or a portion of the Services provided, as specified
        in Section 9 above. THIS SECTION 17.2 SETS FORTH THE COMPANY’S SOLE LIABILITY AND ENTIRE OBLIGATION AND YOUR EXCLUSIVE
        REMEDY FOR ANY CLAIMS THAT THE SERVICES OR YOUR USE THEREOF INFRINGES ANY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. 18. TAXES
        Any and all taxes, except income taxes of the Company, imposed or assessed by reason of this Agreement or its performance,
        including, but not limited to, sales or use taxes, shall be paid by you. 19. ASSIGNMENT You may not assign your rights
        or obligations under this Agreement without the Company’s prior written consent. Subject to this limitation, this
        Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the heirs, successors, and assigns of the parties hereto.
        20. FORCE MAJEURE The Company shall be excused for the period of any delay in the performance of any of its obligations
        under this Agreement when the same is due (in whole or in part) to a cause reasonably beyond the Company’s control,
        including, without limitation, labor disputes, traffic congestion, delivery failures, product shortages, civil commotion,
        war, governmental regulations or controls, government action, fire or other casualty, weather, and/or acts of God.
        21. WAIVER The waiver by either party of a breach or a default by the other party shall not be construed as a waiver
        of any succeeding breach, nor shall any delay or omission on the part of either party to exercise or avail itself
        of any right, power or privilege operate as a waiver of any right, power or privilege by such party. No waiver, consent,
        modification, alteration, addition, or change of terms of this Agreement shall bind either party unless in writing
        and signed by an authorized signatory of the party against whom enforcement is sought, and then such waiver, consent,
        modification or change shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose given. The Company
        shall not be required to give notice to you to enforce strict adherence to all terms of this Agreement. 22. SEVERABILITY
        If any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction,
        such invalidity or unenforceability shall not render the entire Agreement invalid and all remaining provisions of
        this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. In such event, (a) the Agreement shall be construed as if not
        containing the particular invalid or unenforceable provision, and the rights and obligations of each party shall
        be construed and enforced accordingly or (b) to the extent the scope of any provision is too broad in any respect
        to permit enforcement, the parties hereto agree that such scope may be judicially modified accordingly. 23. NOTICES
        Except as explicitly stated otherwise, any notice to the Company shall be given by email to: CustomerService@bask.com.
        Any notice to you shall be sent to the email address that you provide to the Company during the registration process.
        Notice shall be deemed given twenty-four (24) hours after an email is sent, unless the sending party is notified
        that the email address is invalid. Alternatively, the Company may give you notice by certified mail, postage prepaid
        and return receipt requested, to the address provided by you to the Company during the registration process. In such
        case, notice shall be deemed given three (3) days after the date of mailing. You may also send notices to the Company
        by certified mail, postage prepaid and return receipt requested, to the following address: Bask Technology, Inc.,

        and covenants in this Agreement; and each Third Party Provider has all the rights and benefits of the Company under,
        and the ability to enforce, this Agreement. Except as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, this Agreement
        does not and is not intended to confer any rights or remedies upon any person or entity other than you and the Company.
        25. CLAIMS OF COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT The Company takes claims of copyright infringement seriously. It is the Company’s
        policy, in appropriate circumstances and at its discretion, to disable and/or terminate the accounts of users who
