        disclosure and protection policies and practices that apply when personal information is disclosed to us in connection
        with this website. Bask is not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of other websites and/or third party
        software to which you choose to link to or download from this website. You, the user, participate in using the Bask
        website voluntarily. Consent and Revisions to this Privacy Policy Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand
        our policies and practices regarding your information and how we will treat it. By using this website, you consent
        to this Privacy Policy. We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time as we add new features or as laws change
        that may affect our services and we will note the date of our most recent revision above. If we make significant
        changes to this Privacy Policy, and where required by applicable law, we will notify you by either prominently posting
        a notice of such changes prior to implementing the changes or by directly sending you a notification. By continuing
        to use this website after those changes become effective, you consent and agree to be bound by the revised Privacy
        Policy. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, do not use the website and/or our services. This Privacy
        Policy is hereby incorporated in our various service terms and conditions, website use and other agreements and by
        using this website and/or any of Bask’s services accessible through this website or any other Bask website, including,
        without limitation, any of the Bask services, information and tools accessible via the Internet at a Bask-controlled/owned
        web domain (such websites and domains collectively referred to as the “site”), you accept the terms herein. Collecting
        Your Information and How We Use It We collect several types of information from and about users of the site, as further
        described herein, including information by which you may be personally identified, such as name, postal address,
        e-mail address or telephone number (“personal information”). We may also collect information that is about you but
        does not identify you such as your company’s name and your title, and information about your Internet connection,
        the equipment you use to access our site and usage details (and together with the personal information, the “information”).
        We collect this information directly from you when you provide it to us and automatically when you use the site,
        including when you navigate through and interact with our site, as explained below. We use information that we collect
        about you or that you provide to us to provide our services to you, to inform you about updates to our site and the
        services we offer, to provide you with information relating to your purchases, to provide you with other material
        that we think may be of interest to you, and for other purposes with your consent, as explained in greater detail
        below. We may also supplement the information we collect with additional information purchased from third parties
        for marketing purposes. In addition, we may use your information to contact you about services that may be of interest
        to you. If you do not want us to use your information in this way, please see the “Opt-Out Policy” section of this
        Privacy Policy. If you register for an account with us, we collect and store personal information that you submit
        to us. Some of the personal information you may be required to submit includes your name, user ID, password, street
        address, city, state, zip/postal code, country, email address and billing information as described above. Other information
        requested on our registration page, including the ability to receive promotional offers from Bask, may be optional.
        We may, in the future, include other optional requests for information from you, to help us to tailor the site for
        you and deliver personalized information to you. If you decide to purchase a service from us, we will collect only
        the information necessary for authentication and billing purposes. When you place an order, we need to know your
        name, email address, street address, city, state, zip/postal code. For credit card transactions, we will need the
        applicable credit card number, expiration date, security code, and the name as it appears on the card. This information
        allows our third party processing vendor to process and fulfill your orders, and to notify you of your order status.
        If you decide to participate in an online survey or use one of our promotional features, such as a free trial for
        a particular service, if applicable, we may ask for your name, address, email address and other pertinent information
        to administer the survey or promotion and tabulate survey results. Opt-Out Policy We have created mechanisms to provide
        you with the following control over your information: Cookies. Many web browsers automatically accept cookies, but
        most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new cookie,
        and how to disable existing cookies. If you choose to disable cookies, please note that this may impact your use
        of the Bask services as some parts of our site may not function as effectively or may be considerably slower. Information
        and Offers from Bask. If, at any time after registering for information or ordering our services, you change your
        mind about receiving information from us or about our use of information volunteered by you, you can opt-out by emailing
        us your request at CustomerService@bask.com. If you would like to opt-out of marketing or promotional emails, please
        either click “unsubscribe” in the body of the email communication or send an email to Unsubscribe@bask.com to be
        removed. Targeted Advertising. If you do not want us to use information that we collect or that you provide to us
        to deliver advertisements according to our advertisers’ target-audience preferences, you can opt-out by sending us
        an email stating your request to CustomerService@bask.com. For this opt-out to function, you must have your browser
        set to accept browser cookies. We do not control third parties’ collection or use of your information to serve Interest-based
        advertising. However these third parties may provide you with ways to choose not to have your information collected
        or used in this way. You can opt out of receiving targeted ads from members of the Network Advertising Initiative
        (“NAI”) on the NAI’s website. Submitting Your Comments to Bask We value your input and encourage you to help us expand
        and make improvements to the site by providing us with any thoughts or comments you might have regarding our services
        or the operation of our site. You can submit any comments you have to us by clicking on the comment link available
        on our site. When sending us comments, we may receive your email address or user ID, the country in which you are
        located, and other information about you. If you provide this information, we will only use it to acknowledge or
        respond to your comments. Submitting comments via an email will not cause you to receive any secondary or promotional
        material, unless specifically requested by you. In certain circumstances, we may ask for your permission to post
        your comments in marketing or promotional materials. Usage Details, IP Addresses and Cookies We automatically collect
        your browser type and browser software version to tailor the presentation of services to your platform and to maintain
        a record of your activity on the site. To improve our site and make it more useful and interesting to you, we use
        “cookies” for navigation of the site and for customization of information that we may present to you. Cookies are
        small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer’s hard drive and enable users to specify
        unique preferences and to track user trends and patterns. As an automatic process, our web server software records
        a log file of IP addresses that access the site. We also collect IP address information but do not ordinarily link
        IP addresses to users’ personal information. However, will use IP addresses to identify a user when we, in our sole
        discretion, determine that it is necessary to enforce compliance with our various policies or to protect our services,
        site, customers or others. Third-Party Advertiser Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies Some advertisements
        on our site are served by third-party advertisers, ad networks and ad servers. These third parties may use cookies
        alone or in conjunction with web beacons or other tracking technologies to collect information about our users. This
        may include information about your behavior on this and other sites to serve you advertisements that may be of interest
        to you. We do not control these third parties’ tracking technologies or how they may be used. For information about
        how you can opt out of receiving targeted advertising from many providers, please see the “Opt-Out Policy” section
        of this Privacy Policy above. Sharing Your Information Bask enters into co-branding relationships with third-party
        websites and companies to provide products and services to our customers. If you are a Bask customer, Bask may share
        your personal information with certain co-branded third-party service or product providers solely as required to
        provide a specific product or service that you request from a co-branded page or co-branded site (in other words,
        to obtain the services you have selected). However, these third-party partners are obligated not to use this personal
        information for any reason other than to provide the service or product that you have explicitly signed up for. If
        you join Bask through a co-branded site (e.g., on a co-branded registration page), it is Bask’s general policy not
        to share anything other than summarized or aggregated data with the partner; however, any personal information you
        provide may also be received by the co-branded site and could be stored and used by the co-branded service or product
        provider according to their privacy policy. We strongly encourage you to take the time to review these third-party
        privacy policies. In addition, aggregated non-personally identifiable (in other words, anonymous) information is
        routinely gathered for purposes of identifying the use of the site, including information such as what pages are
        being visited most, what domains our visitors are coming from (i.e. google.com), when our servers are busiest, and
        what websites are referring users to us and aggregated data for purposes of analysis and gathering statistical information.
        This information helps us to improve and evaluate our services and marketing efforts. This information may be shared
        with third parties. The treatment of non-personally identifiable information is subject to change in accordance with
        the then applicable law. We own all rights in and to this data. We may also provide these non-personally identifiable
        statistics about our customers’ interests and preferences, services sold, traffic patterns and related site information
        to third parties. Though we use commercially reasonable efforts to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose
        personal information when required by law or legal process (such as a court order), in response to a request by law
        enforcement authorities or in connection with a governmental investigation or under similar circumstances wherein
        we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a governmental
        investigation or directive, court order or legal process, or when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate
        to prevent physical harm or financial loss. We may also disclose personal information to enforce or apply our Service
        Terms and Conditions (located at www.bask.com/terms) and other agreements, including for billing and collection purposes,
        and if we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property, or safety of Bask, our
        customers or others. Additionally, we may disclose personal information that we collect or you provide to us to a
        buyer or other successor in the event of a change in ownership, merger or sale or transfer of some or all of Bask’s
        assets in which personal information held by Bask about our users is among the assets transferred. We will use commercially
        reasonable efforts to notify you (for example, by posting on our site) of any such change in ownership, merger or
        acquisition of Bask’s assets. For clarity, we only use or share personal information provided to us in any the ways
        described in this Privacy Policy. Preventing Unauthorized Access to Your Information When appropriate, we use Secure
        Sockets Layer (SSL) server software to help prevent unauthorized access to the information you submit online. If
        and when you place orders or access your account information, SSL technology encrypts all information you input before
        it is sent to us. You can identify the secure connection by looking at the URL, which will begin with “https:” (instead
        of “http:”). Please note that although we have implemented measures designed to help protect your personal information,
        we cannot guarantee the security of your data as it travels over the Internet. Accessing and Updating Your Information
        If you register for an account with us, you can review the personal information you provided Bask and update such
        information by accessing your account. If you update any of your information, we may keep a copy of the information
        which you originally provided to us in our archives for uses documented herein. If you have questions regarding your
        ability to update or remove information, or relating to this Privacy Policy, you may email us at CustomerService@bask.com.
        We are not responsible for any loss or misuse of your username and password. ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT IN ORDER TO PROTECT
        YOUR PRIVACY YOU SHOULD NOT SHARE YOUR USERNAME OR PASSWORD WITH OTHERS. Use of Your Personal Information Following
        Termination We may save your personal information in the event you desire to reactivate your account and we may contact
        you to offer you new program options. If you would like to opt-out of these Bask marketing or promotional emails,
        please either click “unsubscribe” in the body of the email communication or send an email to Unsubscribe@bask.com
        to be removed. To cancel your service plan(s), refer to the steps outlined in our Service Terms and Conditions available
        at www.bask.com/terms. If you terminate your membership, your personal information cannot be recovered; however,
        you may continue to receive email communications for a short period of time until we have updated all of our databases.
        Notwithstanding the foregoing, your personal information will remain on our archived database and records. We will
        not use this archived personal information except to the extent we believe it may be necessary to prevent fraud or
        future abuse, or if required by law. In addition to the above, we will maintain information on users who have been
        removed for violating any of our agreements. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or the practices
        of this site, you may contact us by using the Contact Us section of the site. Children Under the Age of 13 Our site
        is not intended for children under 13 years of age. We require registered users of the site to be at least 18 years
        of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under age 13. If we learn we have collected
        or received personal information from a child under 13 years of age without verification of parental consent, we
        will delete that information. If you believe we might have any information from or about a child under age 13, please
        contact us at CustomerService@bask.com. Location of Our Servers If you are visiting this website or accessing our
        Services from outside the United States, please be aware that our Services and the servers that host it are located

        be transmitted to the United States and subject to access requests by U.S. authorities. Consent By accessing or using
        the Services or otherwise providing information to us, you consent to our collection and use of your information
